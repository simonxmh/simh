# Kafka 

## Kafka Components

Two abstractions:

Producer - makes content to send to broker
Consumer - consumes content from the broker
Broker - server in between

Topics - logical partition where you write content to

When the producer writes - it has to specify which topic to write to. Consumer needs to specify which topic to read from.

### Kafka Broker

First server that users interact with, listening for TCP connections (9092 port)

### Producer

Can: 
- Publish "John" to "Users" topic
- Publish "Ed" to "Users" topic

Each action is specify by position and location

### Consumer

Consume "Users" topic. It reads from position 0, then 1 ...

### Scale

We need to start sharding..

User topic too big: Partition into two with name A-M and N-Z

## Queue Vs Pub-sub

Queue: message published once, consumed once

Really good for job execution, run a few workers to pull the task and run it once. You don't want it to run more than once.

PubSub: message published once, consumed many times. Want to broadcast the message to many consumers.

Kafka asked: How can we do both???

Answer: Consumer Group. 

## Consumer group

Conduct parallel consuming from partitions. It removes awareness of partition from consumers. Can consume parallel data.

### Queue Behavior

New consumer join group (responsible for all topics in the broker right now)

Any time you consume, you get message from every one of partition 1 & partition 2 ...

You add consumer to group: rebalanced (consumer 1 -> partition 1, consumer 2 -> partition 2)

Consumer 3 cannot join the group (no partition to work with)

Once consumer 1 reads from partition 1, it acts like a queue and pops off the first element. (Consumer 2 never reads the partition 1 element)

If you want to have it act like a queue, put all the consumers in one group

### PubSub Behavior

Put each consumer in a unique group. A partition can be consumed by many consumers.

You get parallel processing for free.

## Distributed System

Have a leader/follower setup (follower reads from leader)

How do I know which broker is the leader?

We want each broker to be a leader of a distinct partition.

### Producing

Write "zain" to topic "users" Partition 2. Any broker can gossip between each other and redirect it to the partition leader.

The follower reads that information from the leader.

## Zookeeper

How do you keep track of which broker is the leader of which partition?

It herds the broker cluster to follow the leader.

## Example

## Pros & Cons of Kafka

### Pros

Append Only commit log - every message you write goes to a log, it's append only. It always goes to the end, appending is very fast.

Performance is amazing

Distributed - can have one leader partition, sharded.

Long polling:
- rabbitMQ when trying to send info to consumer uses the push model, which means consumers cannot consume as fast as producer.
-  Kafka makes consumer ask for a message: hey is there a message? (don't respond if no messages, I will wait.) If there is 700 bytes of message, push it to me. Don't send me empty responses.

Event driven, pub sub and queue - use microservices with it.

Scaling

Parallel processing - can read the topics in parallel

### Cons

Zookeeper - lots of complaints about this at scale. Works weird with microservices, used for service discovery. makes it difficult to maintain

Producer needs the explicit knowledge of partition can lead to problems

Complex installation, configuration and management
