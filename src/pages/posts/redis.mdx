## In Memory, key-value store/ noSQL

- key is a string, value is pretty much anything
- Redis is in-memory first (usually databases store in disk)
- single-threaded (except with durability is enabled)

## Optional Durability

- optionally persist to disk
- journaling: anytime I write a key, go ahead and write it in memory, but also write it to disk. Commit log(append only log)
- snapshotting: instead of logging (which can cause delay), snapshot the whole thing (every 2 seconds or something) turn it to binary and flush it to disk
  - if you write something to memory, and you lose power before the snapshot happens then you may have data loss
- both happen asynchronously

## Transport Protocol

- uses tcp (always 2 way bidirectional connection)
- request/response just like HTTP
- message format is RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol)

## PUB/SUB

- just like kafka, you can subscribe to a channel(topic equivalent). you can publish to that channel, and the client who subscribes will get that message
  - they can switch you to a push model because 2 way tcp protocol

## Replication/Clustering

- replication: one leader many followers model
- clustering : shard data across multiple nodes, usually uses consistent hashing to distribute these shards
- hybrid : nodes become leaders, and each leader will have part of data (shard), and each leader distributes to its followers it's replicate shards

## Example

- redis instance is a server. It's tcp. It needs to listen on a layer 4 port to an IP.
- port number is 6379
- docker run --name rdb -p 6379:6379 redis

- docker exec -it rds redis-cli
