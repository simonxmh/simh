# OSI Model

OSI is Open Systems Interconnect

Extra note:
MAC address - media access control
ie. 10.0.0.3

## Layer 7 Application 

GET / 10.0.0.3:80
http headers cookies, content-type ...etc

## Layer 6 Presentation (optional, used for encryption)

Encrypt if necessary, used by TLS

## Layer 5 Session

Establish session tag it. Session id number. The session id will tag the encryption data. 

## Layer 4 Transport

A bunch of bytes encrypted. What it does is that it breaks down the packet into manageable segments. Each segment is tagged with a lot of info (like port number and source port)

## Layer 3 Network

Takes the blind data, it doesn't know the port, it just knows the segment. It attaches two pieces of info - the source IP and destination IP. This segment is now a **packet**.

It sends the packet ( it doesn't check for errors )

## Layer 2 Data Link

Each packet is passed in. This touches the physical medium. It takes the packets and breaks them down. It then adds headers (target MAC Address) for these small packets called **frames**.

D: us
C: target machine/ web server 
  - sometimes you don't know the MAC Address, in comes **ARP**, which converts IP address into MAC address

## Layer 1 Physical

010101010101011111101010000

Sneaking in bit into electric signals. Transports it to the target.

## Layer 2

Sniffs a fixed size (frame size). It recognizes a frame, It sees whether or not it should receive this. It will match the C MAC address. 

## Layer 3

They take the frames and deal with the MAC Address header.
The packet could be meant for your device but not your application.
This layer removes the headers

## Layer 4

See the application running on the port specified. It sends the packet to the application.
Remove the port number.

## Layer 5

Recognize that this is the particular session. (Each tcp connection has different sessions)

## Layer 6

decrypt

## Layer 7

Server says it gets the request.


## Summary

Layer 1 Physical
This is the physical layer, in which 1 and 0 data bytes can be sent as electric signals, wifi, or light via "the wire"

Layer 2 Data Link
These are the separation of the data bytes into frames.
Notably, the frames will identify the source and destination MAC addresses of the devices' network card.
Since electrical signals travel in all directions in a network, the data frames reach all devices in the network.
Once the data frame is able to identify that the device is not the intended destination, the frames drop.
In an unsecured network, this is where a malicious application can choose to not drop the frames, and steal the data.

Layer 3 Network
Once layer 2 is done, it generalizes the frames from MAC addresses to IP addresses.

Layer 4 Transport
This tranport layer further generalizes the network layer IP address into source and destination ports.

Layer 5 Session
Since there may be several TCP connections to one server at a time, with identical packet information from layers 1 through 4, we need a way to distinguish the session by ID to tag it.

Layer 6 Presentation
This is where the resource might be secured/encrypted with HTTPS/TLS by scrambling the HTTP request string.
I didn't know HTTPS encrypted anything. I thought it was only a way to identify the true identity of a website.
Also, encryption might be accomplished via VPN.
At this step, if the data is encrypted, the model decrypts the information to reach step 7.
It might be possible that a malicious attack to steal data can be avoided by encrypting.
"This is where you can get screwed if you are on public wifi...people can sniff your data."

Layer 7 Application
This is where a client device makes a request to a server device, such as a GET request.
This request contains a whole bunch of information, such as headers, cookies, content-type headers, etc, which is summarized into a string, so the string can participate with the rest of the OSI models as byte data.
