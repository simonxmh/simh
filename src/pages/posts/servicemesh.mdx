## Service Mesh 

Service mesh is a dedicated infrastrucure solution to operation perspective of network interactions between microservices.

Typically it takes care of:

- Traffic management
  - http, https, http2, grpc
  - dynamic routing like conditional, weighting, mirroring
  - resiliency through retry logic, circuit breaker, timeout setting
  - testing through fault injection

- Policy enforcement
  - access control
  - rate limits
  - quota
- Security
  - mTLS, certificate management, external CA
  - secure naming
  - authentication in request or peer mode
  - authorization allowing both allow or deny actions and CRD
- Observability
  - metrics at proxy or service level
  - distributed tracing
  - access logs
- platform support
  - k8s
  - servers


Use service mesh when
- Cluster is multi-tenant or running sensitive workloads
- Need the capabilities of the tool, e2e encryption, observability ..et c
  

## Service Mesh Interface

SMI is standard interface defining a common, portable API to give interoperability across difference service meshes. It helps standardization.

## Istio

full-featured, heavy-weight service mesh. It uses envoy has sidecar, the control plane called istiod has:
- pilot : abstracting platform specific service discovery mechanisms, and use a standard format that the envoy api can use. Distributes authentication policies and secure naming information to proxies. It also implements traffic management like canary, retry.
- Citadel : key and certificate management. wathces lifetime of certificate and rotates the certificates by rewriting secrets.
- Galley : abstracts and gives config to components
- Mixer: enforces access control and usage policies. Collects telemetry. Intermediate layer between istio compoennts and istio-based services.

Choose when you need the capabilities, mesh extension is needed outside of k8s. multi-mesh or mult-cluster or mult-network is needed in deployment model.

## Linkerd

Uses linkerd-proxy developed in Rust. Control plane has:
- Controller: public-api container that gives the api for the CLI and dashboard.
- Destination gets looked up by proxies in data plane
- Identity
- Proxy-injector receives webhook requests when pod gets made and adds an initcontainer and proxy sidecar itself
- Tap receives request from CLI and dashboard
- Web: linkerd dashboard

Suggseted:
-k8s, easy, lightweight, low latency and low overhead

## Consul Connect

Consul is multi data center aware service networking solution. Connect provides service mesh capabilities.

Implements data plane using pluggable proxy, which means you can use its default built-in L4 proxy or Envoy or any proxy of your choice.
- server: consul agent in server mode, need many of the servers to maintain cluster state
- client: consul agent in lightweight client mode. Each node needs a client agent running. It brokers config and policy between workloads.

Suited for:
- multi data center use cases
- Extending existing consul workloads
- mesh across k8s and virtual/physical servers.
